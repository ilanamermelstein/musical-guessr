# Musical Guessr: Final Project for SI 539

This project is a game in which players are sequentially given a one-sentence summary for each of 10 random Broadway musicals that were nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical, and they are given 3 guesses to guess each musical. For each musical, players get 3 points, if they guess it on the first try, 2 points if they guess it on the second try, 1 point if they guess it on the third try, and 0 points if they do not successfully guess it. The maximum possible score is 30, which occurs if a participant guesses all 10 shows correctly, each on the first try. 

Data with Broadway show names and years of nomination from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Musical, and one-sentence summaries created with U-M GPT.
